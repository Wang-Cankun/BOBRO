Description: BOBRO is the an algorithm for prediction of cis-regulatory motifs in a given set of promoter sequences. 
    The algorithm originally published by Ma et al, 2011 at Nucelic Acids Research(https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nar/gkq948).
    This package provides an R implementation of the BOBRO algorithm, with significantly improved efficiency and comprehensive functions.
